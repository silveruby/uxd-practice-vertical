<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to use AngularJS to make use of directives and controller features.</p>

<p>Also, this project will use Bootstrap &amp; follow Google Material Design guidelines.</p>

<p>In order to make the buttons Material like, I am following this cool code example - http://codepen.io/ayamflow/pen/HarIg to make use of getBoundingClientRect() function.</p>

<p>This project is inspired by an article I read last year. It is called <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/08/ux-design-practice-verticals.php">UX Design Practice Vertical</a>.</p>

<p>I love how it beautifully captures all the User Experience related job roles.</p>

<p>My goal is to create an interactive, visually compelling version of it and hopefully provide clarity to more people who are venturing into or already working in any UX roles.</p>
