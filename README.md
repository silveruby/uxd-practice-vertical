## Updates

**6/20/2016**

I updated the code to use AngularFire 2.0.1, which now supports Firebase 3.0. 

I also fixed a few UI issues based on feedbacks from friends. 

Also, I contacted the owner of UXD Practice Verticals and got his permission to reproduce the chart for personal use. This is great because my goal of the project was to share this with people and do a coding project. I have no intention of making money off from this.

[UXDPV.io](http://www.uxdpv.io) is LIVE and in beta mode. 

In the middle of deployment, A new version of Firebase was released by Google on May 18th 2016. Since I'm using AngularFire 1.2.0 with FireBase 2.4.2, the code does not work for new Firebase consoles. This is a headache but it'll have to be resolved when AngularFire updates its code for Firebase 3.0. 

See all the [discussions about Firebase + AngularFire](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire/issues/718) on github. 


**3/1/2015**

I've decided to use AngularJS to make use of directives and controller features. 

Also, this project will use Bootstrap & follow Google Material Design guidelines. 

In order to make the buttons Material like, I am following this [code example](http://codepen.io/ayamflow/pen/HarIg) to make use of getBoundingClientRect() function.

This project is inspired by an article I read last year. It is called [UX Design Practice Vertical](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/08/ux-design-practice-verticals.php). 

I love how it beautifully captures all the User Experience related job roles. 

My goal is to create an interactive and visually compelling version of it to provide clarity to more people who are venturing into or already working in any UX roles.
