			<h3>My story</h3>
			<p>As a UX practitioner, I have wore different hats for many projects. Sometimes I work directly with stakeholders in high-level meetings. And sometimes I am heads down behind my computer fixing away front-end bugs. One of my friend is a content strategist and clients often confuse her role to an editor. <strong>In a world full of clients looking for UX unicorns, itâ€™s challenging to find right UX work.</strong></p>
			<p>I came across the UX Design Practice Verticals article when I was trying to define my UX career. I think this is one of the most clear and helpful description about activities and roles in UX design.</p>
			<p>I started sharing the article with my colleagues. Then I wanted to create my own so I can show it online. After more than 2 years of first reading the article, here's uxdpv.io for everyone.</p>
