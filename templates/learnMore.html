			<h3>My story</h3>
			<p><small><strong>In a world full of clients looking for UX unicorns, itâ€™s challenging to find right UX work.</strong>  As a UX partitioner, I have wore different hats for many projects. Sometimes I work directly with stakeholders in high-level meetings. And sometimes I am heads down behind my computer fixing away front-end bugs. One of my friend is a content strategist and clients often confuse her role to an editor. I think the story I am sharing with you is the story of many UX partitioners.</small></p>

			<h3>Goal of the Site</h3>
			<p><small><strong>The goal of the site is to share the practice verticals with everyone who wants to create their own UX paths.</strong>  In my journey to define my UX skills, I came across an article called UX Design Practice Verticals. It breaks down UX practices into 8 main practice verticals. Each practice verticals has six area of interests, with each one building on top of the previous. I loved the concept and used it to define my UX path.</small></p>
