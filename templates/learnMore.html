			<h3>What Is It?</h3>
			<p>UXDPV is an interactive chart inspired by research in <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/08/ux-design-practice-verticals.php">UX Design practice verticals</a> by <a href="http://www.methodbrain.com">Nathaniel Davis</a>. UX design practice verticals represent a group of eight interrelated areas of practice. Each practice is represented as a vertical that contains six area of interests. Each area of interest builds on the one before it—starting from the bottom.</p>
			<p>UXDPV allows you to identify areas of interest where you have proficiency. You can print your selection or save it for future reference.</p>
